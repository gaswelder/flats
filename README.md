# Flats

This is a tracker for rentable flats.
I made it so I could get notified about interesting offers while I'm busy at work.

Workers (which are not part of this repository) regularly scrape online offers and upload them to the tracker.
The tracker combines everything into one current picture and notifies people according to their filters.
It also builds some historical data, such as prices and offer counts.
